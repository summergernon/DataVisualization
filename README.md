# DataVisualization

I took information from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) that contains all earthquake information for the past day (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). These data are in JSON form. The website updates every five minutes, so the visualization stays up-to-date. I created a Leaflet plot that plots all of the earthquakes in the dataset. The markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake. Higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color. Additionally, the visualization contains additional information about the earthquake when the marker is clicked.
